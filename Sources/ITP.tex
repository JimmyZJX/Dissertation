%Dunfield and Krishnaswami calculus tracks the (partial) solutions of existential variables
%in the algorithmic context; they denote a delayed substitution that is
%incrementally applied to outstanding work as it is encoutered.  
%Instead of reifying the substitution, our algorithm keeps track of an explicit list of
%outstanding work.
