In this chapter, we present a new algorithm for polymorphic subtyping
with mechanical formalizations in the Abella theorem prover.
%
In particular, we show that the problem we have identified from existing systems
can be overcome by means of \emph{worklist judgments}.
These are a form of judgement that turns the complicated
global propagation of unifications into a simple local substitution.
Moreover, we exploit several ideas in the recent inductive
formulation of a type-inference algorithm by
Dunfield and Krishnaswami~\cite{dunfield2013complete}, which turn out to be useful
for mechanization in a theorem prover.

Building on these ideas we develop a complete formalization of
polymorphic subtyping in the Abella theorem prover. Moreover, we
 show that the algorithm is \emph{sound}, \emph{complete} and \emph{decidable} with
respect to the well-known declarative formulation of polymorphic subtyping by
Odersky and L\"aufer.  While these meta-theoretical results are not new, as far
as we know our work is the first to mechanically formalize them.


\section{Overview: Polymorphic Subtyping}

% We hope that
% this work encourages other researchers to use theorem provers for formalizing
% type-inference algorithms.

%Dunfield and Krishnaswami calculus tracks the (partial) solutions of existential variables
%in the algorithmic context; they denote a delayed substitution that is
%incrementally applied to outstanding work as it is encoutered.  
%Instead of reifying the substitution, our algorithm keeps track of an explicit list of
%outstanding work.
