\section{Introduction}





In summary, the contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf A fully mechanized formalization of type inference with
  higher-ranked types:} Our work presents the first fully mechanized formalization
  for type inference of higher ranked types. The formalization is done in the
  Abella theorem prover~\cite{AbellaDesc} and it is available
  online at \url{https://github.com/JimmyZJX/TypingFormalization}.

\item {\bf A new algorithm for DK's type system:} Our work proposes a novel algorithm that implements
  DK's declarative bidirectional type system. We prove
  \emph{soundness}, \emph{completeness} and
  \emph{decidability}. 

\item {\bf Worklists with inference judgments:} One technical contribution is the
  support for inference judgments using worklists. The idea is to
  use a continuation passing style to enable the transfer of inferred information across
  judgments. 

\item {\bf Unification of worklists and contexts:} Another technical contribution is the unification
  between ordered contexts and worklists. This enables precise scope tracking
  of variables in judgments, and avoids the duplication of context information across
  judgments in worklists.

\jimmy{Notes @20190211 4 points of novalty:\\
1) Dealing with inference judgments and CPS-style chains\\
2) The form of the judgment itself with a single shared context\\
3) The way we deal with scope (which may follow from 2)\\
4) Immediate substitution (judgment list)
