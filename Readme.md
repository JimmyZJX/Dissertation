# My PhD Thesis

I am using the template by [Xuan Bi](https://github.com/bixuanzju/PhD-thesis),
which is based on [latex-mimosis](
https://github.com/Submanifold/latex-mimosis).


To compile the document, please install the `Minion Pro` font and use XeTex.
You may refer to the README of [latex-mimosis](
https://github.com/Submanifold/latex-mimosis)
for more instructions on the required packages, etc.
