abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.}

abstract = {This paper formalises within first-order logic some common practices in computer science to do with representing and reasoning about syntactical structures involving lexically scoped binding constructs. It introduces Nominal Logic, a version of first-order many-sorted logic with equality containing primitives for renaming via name-swapping, for freshness of names, and for name-binding. Its axioms express properties of these constructs satisfied by the FM-sets model of syntax involving binding, which was recently introduced by the author and M.J. Gabbay and makes use of the Fraenkel–Mostowski permutation model of set theory. Nominal Logic serves as a vehicle for making two general points. First, name-swapping has much nicer logical properties than more general, non-bijective forms of renaming while at the same time providing a sufficient foundation for a theory of structural induction/recursion for syntax modulo α-equivalence. Secondly, it is useful for the practice of operational semantics to make explicit the equivariance property of assertions about syntax – namely that their validity is invariant under name-swapping.}

abstract = {Modern functional programming languages, such as Haskell or OCaml, use sophisticated forms of type inference. While an important topic in the Programming Languages research, there is little work on the mechanization of the metatheory of type inference in theorem provers. In particular we are unaware of any complete formalization of the type inference algorithms that are the backbone of modern functional languages. This paper presents the first full mechanical formalization of the metatheory for higher-ranked polymorphic type inference. The system that we formalize is the bidirectional type system by Dunfield and Krishnaswami (DK). The DK type system has two variants (a declarative and an algorithmic one) that have been manually proven sound, complete and decidable. We present a mechanical formalization in the Abella theorem prover of DK’s declarative type system with a novel algorithmic system. We have a few reasons to use a new algorithm. Firstly, our new algorithm employs worklist judgments, which precisely capture the scope of variables and simplify the formalization of scoping in a theorem prover. Secondly, while DK’s original formalization comes with very well-written manual proofs, there are several details missing and some incorrect proofs, which complicate the task of writing a mechanized proof. Despite the use of a different algorithm we prove the same results as DK, although with significantly different proofs and proof techniques. Since such type inference algorithms are quite subtle and have a complex metatheory, mechanical formalizations are an important advance in type-inference research.},

abstract = {Type inference for parametric polymorphism is wildly successful, but has always suffered from an embarrassing flaw: polymorphic types are themselves not first class. We present Quick Look, a practical, implemented, and deployable design for impredicative type inference. To demonstrate our claims, we have modified GHC, a production-quality Haskell compiler, to support impredicativity. The changes required are modest, localised, and are fully compatible with GHC's myriad other type system extensions.},

abstract = {ML is remarkable in providing statically typed polymorphism without the programmer ever having to write any type annotations. The cost of this parsimony is that the programmer is limited to a form of polymorphism in which quantifiers can occur only at the outermost level of a type and type variables can be instantiated only with monomorphic types.  Type inference for unrestricted System F-style polymorphism is undecidable in general. Nevertheless, the literature abounds with a range of proposals to bridge the gap between ML and System F.  We put forth a new proposal, FreezeML, a conservative extension of ML with two new features. First, let- and lambda-binders may be annotated with arbitrary System F types. Second, variable occurrences may be frozen, explicitly disabling instantiation. FreezeML is equipped with type-preserving translations back and forth between System F and admits a type inference algorithm, an extension of algorithm W, that is sound and complete and which yields principal types.},
