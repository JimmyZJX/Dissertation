First, I would like to give my most sincere thanks to my supervisor Prof. Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira.
Six years ago, I was lucky to get a chance exchanging to HKU and
took two courses taught by Bruno,
and both of them are quite challenging and interesting at the same time.
Since then, I decide to explore more on programming languages and
therefore applied for Bruno's Ph.D. student.
It turns out to be a wise choice!
Regular meetings with him is usually quite informative, encouraging and fun.
Bruno is a very patient person;
he always provide professional suggestions on how to proceed the research when I get stuck or
move in the wrong direction.
In short, I would never expect a better supervisor.

Collaborations in research have been unforgettable experiences.
Prof. Tom Schrijvers offered help on my type inference project,
giving me invaluable ideas and suggestions on both research, writing, and presentation.
This piece of work contributes to the most recognized publications during my Ph.D.,
which won the distinguished paper award in ICFP.
I also participated in projects of my colleagues Xuejing Huang and Yaoda Zhu,
which are both challenging and interesting. I learnt a lot from you as well.
I would like to thank everyone in the group, for your enlightening seminars and discussions:
